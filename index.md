### About me
I am a PhD student in Finance at the University of Melbourne. I hold a Master of Journalism and Communication from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a Master of Management Studies from the University of Southern California. My previous research spans culture, social media, and emerging financial technologies.
In my free time, I enjoy art and music; I play a little guitar and piano, and I also sketch and paint.
