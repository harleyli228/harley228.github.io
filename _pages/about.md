I am a PhD student in Finance at the University of Melbourne. I hold a Master of Journalism and Communication from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a Master of Management Studies from the University of Southern California. My previous research spans cultural economics, media, and emerging financial technologies. I have published in Telematics and Informatics Reports and presented my work on cryptocurrency market dynamics at the IEEE International Conference on Big Data.
